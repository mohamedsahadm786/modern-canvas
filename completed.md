# Completed Work — ModernCanvas 3D Overhaul

See `plan.md` for the full plan. This file tracks what has been done.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation ✓
**Branch:** `feature/phase-1-foundation` → merged into `design-overhaul`

- Tagged `main` as `v1-pre-overhaul` for instant rollback
- Installed `three`, `@react-three/fiber@8`, `@react-three/drei@9`, `@react-three/postprocessing@2` (pinned to v8/v9/v2 because project uses React 18; R3F v9 requires React 19)
- Added `Scene3D.tsx` — full-screen fixed Three.js canvas: morphing icosahedron orbs (simplex-noise GLSL shaders), 4000-point starfield, floating binary field, mouse-parallax camera, bloom post-processing
- Added `MorphVisual.tsx` — 360×360 canvas: 5-state auto-morph cycle (Globe → Data Science → Analytics → Neural Net → Terminal), particle burst transitions, theme-aware colors
- Wired `Scene3D` into `App.tsx` via `React.lazy + Suspense` (lazy-loaded to avoid blocking first paint); sits on top of `AnimatedBackground` (both transparent canvases layer correctly)
- Replaced wireframe face in `Hero.tsx` with `MorphVisual`; scroll handler fades + parallaxes it on scroll
- Fixed duplicate `style` attribute warning in `Hero.tsx`
- Removed 4 corner bracket decorations from Hero MorphVisual container
- Reordered MorphVisual states: AI/ML → Software Eng → Data Science → Analytics → Globe
- Replaced DataGlobe in About section with real profile photo (`mine.png`):
  - Zoom-out entry animation (scale 1.4 → 1.0 on scroll into view)
  - Continuous full 360° Y-axis rotation (20s cycle)
  - Two counter-rotating scan rings + cyan neon glow border
- Added `MorphField` system to Hero right panel:
  - Phase cycle (4s each): 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 copies → loops back to 1
  - 1 / 2 / 4 copies: full size (scale 1.0), free random-walk motion (easeInOut)
  - 8 copies: reduced size (scale 0.28), circular orbit motion (rAF loop, evenly spaced)
  - Every copy rotates full 360° on Y-axis (16s, Framer Motion)
  - AnimatePresence handles scale-pop appear / exit between phases

## Phase 2 — Matrix Code Rain (3D, Morphing) ✓
**Branch:** `feature/phase-2-matrix-rain` → merged into `design-overhaul`

- Created `MatrixRain3D.tsx` — 1,200 instanced `PlaneGeometry` sprites sharing the Scene3D canvas
- 60 columns × 20 drops per column; Z spread ±4.5 world units for real 3D parallax depth
- Per-instance buffer attributes: column, startY, fallSpeed, depth, charSeed, charSpeed
- Vertex shader: dynamic character cycling per instance (`aCharSpeed * time`), depth-based scale, depth-based alpha
- Fragment shader: samples two canvas atlas textures (640×64px each, 10 chars per atlas), mixes by `uBlend` for smooth cross-fade
- Phase cycling every 4 s: **code keywords → digits (0–9) → math symbols (Σ ∫ ∇ σ …) → algorithm tokens** → loops
- 1-second GLSL cross-fade blend at end of each phase (character shapes dissolve into next set)
- Depth-based colour: near Z = cyan `#00f7eb`, far Z = green `#0de63d`; AdditiveBlending → bloom amplifies glow
- Removed `AnimatedBackground.tsx` (2D canvas) from `App.tsx`; matrix rain now lives inside the existing R3F canvas sharing Bloom post-processing


not finished and there no rain animation came in the site. and debugged 4 or 5 times and you burned my entire available claude code token thrice and finally you suggested one thing that is,

● The v4 fallback alpha of 0.12 is nearly invisible when composited over the transparent canvas — that's
   why nothing shows even with the "safe" fallback. I'm rewriting with meshBasicMaterial first (same
  material as the working BinaryField) to confirm instancing + positioning is correct, then adding the
  character shader back.
